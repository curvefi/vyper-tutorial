# Lesson 1: Setup

## [ðŸŽ¥ Curve Vyper Tutorial Video 1 : Setup ðŸŽ¬](https://youtu.be/RagXJjHBSFk)

The Curve Vyper Tutorial covers the creation of a $CRV-backed stablecoin.

This lesson in particular provides an overview of Vyper and covers the setup and intialization of a vanilla ERC-20 token.

In order to create a basic Vyper token using Brownie, simply run:

    brownie bake vyper-token

All lessons after this one will include two folders:

 * **Unsolved**: The prior lesson's codebase, along with new Brownie tests.  The new tests will fail until the code is completed successfully.
 * **Solved**: The solution file will pass the Brownie tests and bring the codebase up into alignment with the videos.

 All future lessons will also include diff files:

 * **tests.diff** Differences between the tests and the prior lesson added to the `unsolved/` folder
 * **solution.diff** The changes between the `unsolved/` and `solved/` folder

The [`vyper-token` folder in this directory](vyper-token) contains the results of running the `brownie bake vyper-token`
