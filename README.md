## About This Tutorial

This tutorial covers how to build a $CRV-backed stablecoin using Vyper.

To complete this course we recommend you have a basic understanding of Brownie, which you can obtain by completing the first four lessons of the associated [Brownie Tutorial](https://github.com/curvefi/brownie-tutorial).

Each lesson (except the first) contains a `Solved` and an `Unsolved` folder within this companion [Github repository](https://github.com/curvefi/vyper-tutorial).  

* The `Unsolved` folder contains the prior lesson's completed exercise, plus new tests.  You can work along with the video in this folder.  If you complete the lesson correctly, the tests will pass.
* The `Solved` folder contains the finished copy containing the final work completed in each video.

Each lesson (except the first) will also contain two diff files, representing the changes in the tests (`tests.diff`) and the changes in other files representing the solution (`solution.diff`).
